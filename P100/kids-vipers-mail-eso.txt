Dear Monika,

We are this week planning our next KiDS analyses, and are very much enjoying the higher data rates from the VST these days! One thing I would like to confirm with you is whether we can assume that the new reduced footprint for KiDS is approved, as we proposed in our P99 OPC report. To summarize:

* given that viking ended at 1350 sq.deg. we proposed limiting KiDS to the same area, (essentially sacrificing one degree of width for the survey strips)
* for the purposes of photometric redshift calibration we requested to move ~20 of these KiDS tiles to fields with massive deep spectroscopic redshift surveys (mainly VIPERS and VVDS). KiDS observations on these fields allow us to tie photometric redshifts directly to spectroscopic ones, and address the main systematic uncertainty in the cosmology analysis.

We are also going to be submitting a P100 proposal for VISTA observations of these same extra areas, using VIKING-like OB's, in order to be able to extend our photometric redshift measurements to 9-band from KiDS+VIKING.

Can you confirm therefore that this would work? Most of these fields are at 22-2h, so we would need to add a few KiDS tiles to the queue in the next few months.

Yours
Konrad & Jelte
